      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Feathren are the representation of something new from something old. A step beyond their ancestral griffon heritage, these bipedal creatures celebrate their individuality amidst the cries and jeers from common folk. Originally born from the Astral Plane, where all things can be lost, found, and remade, feathren now walk the Material Plane in search of new ideas, materials, and direction. Filled with endless curiosity, many make their way through the world as adventurers and artisans, taking care to learn what they can from their experiences before moving on to the next one.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Age</name>
      <text>Young feathren are born from eggs and mature more quickly than humans do, reaching maturity by age 8 and typically living to be around 70.

    <trait>
      <name>Alignment</name>
      <text>Feathren can be mercurial and admire variety and expression, and as a result tend to lean towards the gentler aspects of chaos. They are more often good than not, although some allow their vanity to turn to greed and evil.

          <name>Spellcasting</name>
        <text>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.</text>
        <text/>
        <text>Spell Slots:</text>
        <text>   The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text>   For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.</text>
        <text/>
        <text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher:</text>
        <text>   You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</text>
        <text>   The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
        <text>   Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
        <text/>
        <text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
        <text>   Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>

Emulating the Beast Master archetype means committing yourself to this ideal, working in partnership with an animal as its companion and friend.</text>

        <text>You gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. Add your proficiency bonus to the beast's AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or four times your ranger level, whichever is higher. Like any creature, the beast can spend Hit Dice during a short rest.</text>
        <text>The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help action. If you don't issue a command, the beast takes the Dodge action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.</text>
        <text>If you are incapacitated or absent, your beast companion acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. It never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.</text>
        <text>While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</text>
        <text>If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by spending 8 hours magically bonding with another beast that isn't hostile to you, either the same type of beast as before or a different one.</text>

        <text>Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.</text>

        <name>Swarmkeeper: It's Your Swarm</name>
        <text>   A Swarmkeeper's swarm and spells are reflections of the character's bond with nature spirits. Take the opportunity to describe the swarm and the ranger's magic in play. For example, when your ranger casts gaseous form, they might appear to melt into the swarm, instead of a cloud of mist, or the arcane eye spell could create an extension of your swarm that spies for you. Such descriptions don't change the effects of spells, but they are an exciting opportunity to explore your character's narrative through their class abilities. For more guidance on customizing spells, see the "Personalizing Spells" section in chapter 3.</text>
        <text>   Also, remember that the swarm's appearance is yours to customize, and don't feel confined to a single appearance. Perhaps the spirits' look changes with the ranger's mood or with the seasons. You decide!</text>

        <name>Stormcaller: Gale Step</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you can channel the power of the wind into your own movements and attacks. When you move for the first time on your turn, you can double your speed until the end of the turn. If you move at least 10 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a weapon attack before the end of the turn, the attack deals an extra 1d8 thunder damage. When you reach 11th level in this class, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</text>
        <text>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns.</text>

        <name>Stormcaller: Rain Cloak</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you learn to cloak yourself under cover of rain. While in light or heavy precipitation, you can use a bonus action on your turn to turn invisible until the start of your next turn, or until you attack, make a damage roll, or force someone to make a saving throw. Additionally, you don’t have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made when observing areas that are lightly obscured by heavy rain, falling snow, mist, or other water-based phenomena.</text>

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Stormcaller: Darken Skies</name>
        <text>At 7th level, you gain the ability to draw storm clouds overhead. If you are able to see the sky when you finish a short or long rest, you can cause dark clouds to form in a 1-mile radius directly above you. These dark clouds count as stormy conditions for the purpose of spells such as call lightning, and the weather in the area changes to light rain or light snow.</text>
        <text>If it is already lightly raining or lightly snowing when you use this feature, you can instead cause the weather in the area to worsen, turning light precipitation into heavy precipitation.</text>
        <text>Changes in weather caused by this feature persist for a number of hours equal to your ranger level or until dispersed naturally or by magic.</text>

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Stormcaller: Cyclone Burst</name>
        <text>Beginning at 11th level, you can unleash a vicious cyclone of winds around you. When you move for the first time on your turn while using your Gale Step feature, you can force each creature within 10 feet of you to make a Strength saving throw against your ranger spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from you and knocked prone. This wind also blows away any smoke, mist, or fog in the area.</text>

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Stormcaller: Shielded by Wind and Rain</name>
        <text>At 15th level, you can bend the winds around you into a barrier against arrows and other missiles. While you aren’t incapacitated, you have half cover against ranged attacks. Additionally, when a creature you can see makes a ranged attack against a target within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to grant the target half cover against the attack.</text>
        <text>If you are standing in light or heavy precipitation, both instances of half cover become three-quarters cover.</text>
