      <feature>
        <name>Dragon Spark</name>
        <text>When you become a demi-dragon, you internalize a spark of inherent magical power that fuels your new form and allows you to mimic the extraordinary abilities of a true dragon. The power of this spark is a measure of the magical essence you have accumulated.</text>
        <text>Charisma is your ability for specific class features. You use Charisma whenever a feature gained through this class refers to your Dragon Spark. In addition, you use Charisma when setting the saving throw DC for such an effect and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
        <text/>
        <text>Dragon Spark save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</text>

      <feature>
        <name>Devour Magic</name>
        <text>To sustain your new form, you have developed an innate ability that lets you consume magic. As an action, choose one creature, object, or magical effect within a range of 10 feet of you. Any spell of a level lower than or equal to one third your demi-dragon level (minimum 1) on the target is dispelled. For each spell of a level higher than that, make a Charisma check. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the spell is dispelled. Regardless of success, you then regain hit points equal to your demi-dragon level + your Constitution modifier (minimum 1). Effects that refer to dispel magic also apply to this feature, such as wall of force.</text>
        <text>You can use this feature once, and must finish a long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 5th level, the range increases to 60 feet. At 18th level, you can use it twice before a long rest.</text>

      <feature>
        <name>Dragon's Breath</name>
        <text>Destructive energy simmers within you, waiting to be released. When you gain this feature, choose between a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide or a 15-foot cone. Additionally, choose a damage type from among the following: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.</text>
        <text>As an action, you exhale destructive energy. Each creature in the area you chose must make a saving throw against your Dragon Spark save DC. A creature takes 2d8 damage of the chosen type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If you chose acid, fire, or lightning, the target must make a Dexterity saving  throw. If you chose cold or poison, the target must make a Constitution saving throw.</text>
        <text>The damage and range of this feature increase as you gain demi-dragon levels, as shown in the Dragon's Breath Damage and Range columns of the Demi-Dragon table.</text>
        <text>You can use this feature twice. You regain all uses of it after finishing a short or long rest. Starting at 13th level, you can use it three times before a rest.</text>

While gliding, you can as part of your movement move up to 40 feet in any horizontal direction, or dive straight down. When you land, you take no falling damage and can land on your feet. You can also start gliding by expending at least 10 feet of movement as part of a high jump.</text>

      <feature>
        <name>Absorb Magic</name>
        <text>You gain the ability to absorb the magical enchantment of a weapon or piece of equipment. This grants you access to the magical powers provided by that item, and removes it from the item. The stolen magic harmlessly flows through your veins. You can absorb an enchantment from a magical item as part of a long rest, during which the item must be in your possession. Once absorbed, you can use the item's magical properties as if you were wearing or wielding the item. The stolen magical power follows all rules that would normally apply to it.</text>
        <text>You can return the enchantment to the original item as part of a short or long rest. When returning an enchantment, you do not need to have the item in your possession. You can have a maximum of 5 such enchantments active at any one time. If the item requires attunement to use, it follows normal attunement rules, and you count as being attuned while the enchantment remains absorbed by you. You can't absorb an item's magic if doing so would cause you to be attuned to more than your maximum attunements.</text>
        <text>You can't absorb the power of shields or artifacts. Additionally, the Dungeon Master may rule that a specific item's enchantment can't be absorbed. Only enchantments on items that are designed to be equipment (worn or wielded) may be absorbed. You can't combine these enchantments in any way that would not normally be possible—you can't, for instance, benefit from more than one weapon enchantment when making an attack, but if multiple such enchantments are available to you, you can decide which one to use each time you make an attack.</text>
        <text>Should a cursed item be absorbed, the curse functions as normal. You can rid yourself of the curse after fulfilling its requirements, such as by using the remove curse spell. Doing so temporarily allows you to return the cursed enchantment to its item as part of a short or long rest.</text>
