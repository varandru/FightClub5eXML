        <name>Psionic Archetype</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you pick the archetype of psion you embody, choosing from Awakened Mind, Unleashed Mind, Transcended Mind, Shaper’s Mind, Wandering Mind, or Consuming Mind, each of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level, and again at 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

      <feature>
        <name>Psionics</name>
        <text>Psionic Disciplines</text>
        <text>You are granted access to a psionic discipline (such as Telepathy or Telekinesis) by your chosen archetype. A psionic discipline comes with a passive feature that expands your character’s capabilities and an active psionic power that can be modified and empowered with psi points. Additionally you can use your discipline in more detailed applications to recreate the effect of certain spells, listed at the end of the discipline description. At 3rd level you can select a second discipline, and 18th level you can select a 3rd discipline.</text>
        <text>Psionic powers are suppressed by antimagic fields and can be dispelled with dispel magic, but are only affected by counterspell if recreating the effect of a spell. Any check required to dispel magic, counterspell or to identify a spell being cast with psionics is made with disadvantage unless the caster also has the Psionics feature. The detect magic spell will detect the usage of psionics, but not their nature: it will show up as a mysterious untyped power, even if being used to generate the effect of a spell.</text>
        <text>When recreating a spell through a psionic effect (using a psionic discipline to cast the spell) the spell has no material or verbal components, but using any psionic ability requires somatic components and causes the psion to vibrantly glow with the otherworldly psionic energies they are controlling.</text>
        <text>Psi Points</text>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, you gain access to psi points used to fuel psionic discipline powers and effects. You have a number of psi points equal to your psion level, and you regain all spent points when you finish a short or long rest. You can spend a number of psi points equal to half your Psion level (rounded up) at a time. For example, if you’re a 5th-level Psion, you can spend 3 psi points on a psionic power or cast a spell with a cost of 3 psi points.</text>
        <text>Psionic Ability</text>
        <text>Psionic powers, Psionic Talents, and spells gained through this class use your psionic ability.</text>
        <text>Psionic ability save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>

This can be spent to empower psionic disciplines, but not to recreate spells or fuel Psionic Talents. If you have any unspent free psi points granted by this feature left at the end of your turn, then they are lost.</text>

You can use this innate ability to cast that spell once. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At higher levels, you gain more innate abilities of your choice that can be used in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Innate Psionics when you finish a long rest.</text>

    <autolevel level="1">
      <feature>
        <name>Psion Archetype: Awakened Mind</name>
        <text>An Awakened Mind is a psion who had their psionic power awakened within them by an encounter, event, or circumstance. Perhaps their powers were latent or perhaps their destiny had been that of a normal creature until powers were suddenly thrust on them. Perhaps they brushed the realms beyond in a vivid dream, perhaps they wandered the Feywild and came back warped, perhaps they merely glimpsed the eyes of a creature that did not belong walking down the street.</text>
        <text>An awakening is often somewhat traumatic. Psions are not well understood and the first power they manifest—telepathy — is one of the most feared and shunned abilities</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Awakened Mind: Opened Mind</name>
        <text>At 1st level when you select this archetype, your mind awakens the ability to directly connect to the minds of other creatures, granting the psionic discipline of Telepathy.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Awakened Mind: Mental Awareness</name>
        <text>Additionally, starting at 1st level, you can use Intelligence instead of Wisdom when making an Insight check against a creature with an Intelligence ability score of 6 or higher.</text>
        <text>Further, if you have telepathically communicated with a willing creature, you know their general location (direction and rough estimate of distance) for the next hour as long as you are on the same plane as them</text>
      </feature>

    <autolevel level="3">
      <feature>
        <name>Awakened Mind: Mind Reader</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, when you use Telepathic Intrusion, you can force the target to make an Intelligence saving throw instead of a Wisdom saving throw against the power (deciding when you use the ability).</text>
        <text>When a creature fails a saving throw against your Telepathic Intrusion, you gain a d4. Until the end of your next turn, if you make an attack roll against the creature or the creature makes a saving throw against one of your psionic powers other than Telepathic Intrusion, you can add or subtract the d4 from the roll (deciding to roll before you roll the attack or use the power).</text>

You gain a mindsight of 60 feet, allowing you to see creatures with an Intelligence of 6 or higher within range as if by blindsight. A creature you are unaware of can still be hidden from you, but you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier when making Perception checks to detect creatures.</text>

    <autolevel level="1">
<feature optional="YES">
        <name>Psion Archetype: Unleashed Mind</name>
        <text>An Unleashed Mind’s power is most often an innate force they struggle to understand or control, a reflection of their state of mind and mood projected onto the world around them, often to devastating results. The life of an Unleashed Psion is frequently their journey to control their unruly powers... or one of embracing the destructive powers fully.</text>
        <text>What the wellspring of their innate power is varies: they could be a psionic race, born under the influence of distant twisted powers, warped by fey blood, or a herald of something more sinister brushing against the material world. Sometimes their power will show itself in simple applications, but most often their power becomes known and feared when their temper flares.</text>
        <text>Their alignment frequently depends on the approach to their powers they have taken. An Unleashed Psion who emphasizes control and restraint, keeping their emotions from running wild and their powers from running rampant will most often be lawful, following strict personal codes. On the other hand, an Unleashed Psion who lets their power run rampant will almost always be chaotic in nature, acting on impulse... with great emphasis.</text>
      </feature>
<feature optional="YES">
        <name>Unleashed Mind: Unshackled Power</name>
        <text>At 1st level when you select this archetype, you gain the ability to unleash your mind to physically interact with the world around you, granting you the psionic discipline of Telekinesis.</text>

        <name>Unleashed Mind: Overwhelming Power</name>
        <text>Additionally at 1st level, you gain the ability to cast thaumaturgy with your psionic powers. When you cast it in this way, you have an additional options:</text>
        <text>• You cause up to 10 pounds of loose objects within 10 feet of you to start floating for 1 minute.</text>
        <text>• You can force all targets within 5 feet to make a Strength saving throw, or be pushed 5 feet away from you.</text>

        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you gain a d4 rampage die. Once on each of your turns when making a damage roll, you can add this rampage die to the damage roll. If you dealt damage during your last turn, your rampage die becomes a d6, increasing with each subsequent turn you deal damage by one step, up to a d12; if you did not deal damage during your last turn or become incapacitated, it becomes a d4 once more.

If your roll + your Constitution modifier is higher than the excess damage you took, you are instead reduced to one hit point. You can expend 2 psi points to roll an additional rampage die, adding it to the result.</text>

    <autolevel level="1">
<feature optional="YES">
        <name>Psion Archetype: Transcended Mind</name>
        <text>A Transcended psion is most often one that has found their path to psionic powers through a mental epiphany, realizing the place of their mind within the multiverse and how it ties to everything else, seeing the keys and levers to the world laid out before them in their mind’s eye.</text>
        <text>Most often achieved either intentionally or accidentally through meditation and ritual, this can sometimes even be a passed on technique to reliably transcend the strictly material concerns, and explore the more cognitive realm and powers within.</text>
        <text>Transcended Psions tend to have the best grasp on their powers in control and principle, having come to understand the greater cosmos, but lack the reckless abandon some other Psions may have. Unfortunately less transcendent minds frequently cannot understand the greater truths they have learned and may view a Transcended Psion as a bit... peculiar.</text>

The maximum value of the pool is your psion level, and any points beyond the maximum are lost.

You can’t manifest more than one emotion at a time, and if it is destroyed, you take 2d6 psychic damage from the backlash.</text>
    <text>This manifestation is not a sentient creature of its own, but simply a manifestation of your emotion.</text>

When you gain access to the Innate Psionics feature, you may expend a use of Innate Psionics to cast divide self at the level of the use of Innate Psionics expended. For example, if you choose the teleport spell for your Innate Psionics feature at 13th level, you could expend a casting of teleport to instead cast divide self as a 7th-level spell, and can’t cast teleport or divide self as a 7th-level spell in this way until you finish a long rest.</text>
  <text>You do not require the material components of the spell when you cast it by expending psi points or a use of Innate Psionics.</text>

  <name>Talent: Empowered Strike</name>
  <prerequisite>Psychokinesis or Telekinetics Discipline</prerequisite>

When you hit a creature with a weapon, you can apply Elemental Blast or Telekinetic Force modifiers (you can only select a power you know) to the attack (you can use Psionic Mastery on this). This doesn’t deal the base damage of the power, but any added damage causes the additional effects of the power to occur.</text>
  <text>When applying a modifier that would make it target an area of effect, only the target takes the weapon damage, but other creatures in the radius become a target of the attack as if using the power normally.</text>

  <name>Talent: Perfect Focus</name>
  <prerequisite>10th-level Psion</prerequisite>
  <text>You can enter a state of extreme focus. Your concentration is no longer interrupted by using a second ability that requires concentration, but your speed is reduced to 0 while concentrating on more than one effect; you have a −5 penalty to any Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration. If you move or fail a save to maintain concentration, one of the spells you are concentrating on ends. If you fail the saving throw to maintain concentration by 5 or more, you lose concentration on both spells.</text>
</feat>
  <feat>
  <name>Talent: Personal Truth</name>
  <prerequisite/>
  <text>Your power of conviction allows you to believe what you choose to. If you spend at least one minute convincing yourself of something—no matter how absurd—spells and effects to determine if you are telling the truth will register that you believe what you have convinced yourself of.</text>
  <text>Additionally, your psionic powers allow you to impose your will upon reality to a certain extent. When you expend 1 psi point, you can perform a minor alteration to reality:</text>
  <text>• You can conjure any Tiny object you can imagine that is worth 1 sp or less. This creates an object as you envision it, but doesn’t grant you knowledge you do not otherwise have (for example, you would be unable to conjure a key to a lock unless you had a perfect mental image of the correct key).</text>
  <text>• As an action, you can change the color or taste of a Small or smaller object with 10 feet. This change lasts for 1 minute.</text>

</feat>
  <feat>
  <name>Talent: Psi Crystal</name>
  <prerequisite/>
  <text>You gain the ability to impart part of your mind into crystal. You can expend 2 psi points to cast the find familiar spell, but your familiar takes on the statics of a psi crystal (below) and the material component required is a crystal worth 10 gp instead of the normal material components. The Psi Crystal gains your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can use Psionic Disciplines with a range greater than self through your Psi Crystal as if you were standing in its location. If the psi crystal is destroyed, you gain its memories as your own. While you have a Psi Crystal active, as a bonus action, you can deactivate it to regain 2 expended psi points.</text>
  <text>When you summon a Psi Crystal, you can store a fragment of your personality in it that you can then release by shattering the crystal. Select one of the following when summoning a psi crystal.</text>
  <text>Courage. When you make a saving throw against the frightened condition, you can use your reaction to shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion to gain advantage on the save.</text>
  <text>Cowardice. When your Psi Crystal is within 30 of you and a creature comes within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion and immediately moving up to your speed away from the creature without taking any opportunity attacks.</text>
  <text>Cruelty. When your Psi Crystal is within 30 feet of a creature that takes damage, you can use your reaction to shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion and causing the creature to take additional damage equal to your psion level.</text>
  <text>Sympathy. When your Psi Crystal is within 30 feet of you and another creature, if that creature takes damage, you can use your reaction to shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion and granting the creature resistance to that damage. You take an equal amount of damage to the damage they take.</text>

  <text>At higher levels you can expend additional psi points to further enhance the Psionic Weapon; 2 points to enhance it to 2d6 at 5th level, 3 points to enhance it to 3d6 at 11th level, and 4 points to enhance it to 4d6 at 17th level.</text>
</feat>

  <prerequisite>5th-level Psion</prerequisite>
  <text>You can spend 1 psi point to temporarily divide your mind to do two things at once until the end of your turn. While dividing your mind, if you use your action on a psionic power or spell granted by a Psionic Discipline, you can use your bonus action to use a psionic power that would normally take an action. The two powers share your per use psi point limit between them.</text>

    <text>You cause up to six pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target the ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10-foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.
If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save.
If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes 6d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature's choice) against the spell's save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.
At Higher Levels:
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can create two additional pillars for each slot level above 6th.

Dedication: You touch one humanoid who wishes to be dedicated to your god's service. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes a saving throw, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the save. A creature can benefit from this rite only once.
Funeral Rite: You touch one corpse, and for the next 7 days, the target can't become undead by any means short of a wish spell.
Wedding: You touch adult humanoids willing to be bonded together in marriage. For the next 7 days, each target gains a +2 bonus to AC while they are within 30 feet of each other. A creature can benefit from this rite again only if widowed.

    <text>You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.
Chaos Bolt
d8 | Damage Type
1 | Acid
2 | Cold
3 | Fire
4 | Force
5 | Lightning
6 | Poison
7 | Psychic
8 | Thunder
If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.
A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.
At Higher Levels:
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes 1d6 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.

    <text>You take control of the air in a 100-foot cube that you can see within range. Choose one of the following effects when you cast the spell. The effect lasts for the spell's duration, unless you use your action on a later turn to switch to a different effect. You can also use your action to temporarily halt the effect or to restart one you've halted.
Gusts: A wind picks up within the cube, continually blowing in a horizontal direction you designate. You choose the intensity of the wind: calm, moderate, or strong. If the wind is moderate or strong, ranged weapon attacks that pass through it or that are made against targets within the cube have disadvantage on their attack rolls. If the wind is strong, any creature moving against the wind must spend 1 extra foot of movement for each foot moved.
Downdraft: You cause a sustained blast of strong wind to blow downward from the top of the cube. Ranged weapon attacks that pass through the cube or that are made against targets within it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. A creature must make a Strength saving throw if it flies into the cube for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there flying. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.
Updraft: You cause a sustained updraft within the cube, rising upward from the cube's bottom side. Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from the fall. When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can jump up to 10 feet higher than normal.

    <text>While speaking an intricate incantation, you cut yourself with a jewel-encrusted dagger, taking 2d4 piercing damage that can't be reduced in any way. You then drip your blood on the spell's other components and touch them, transforming them into a special construct called a homunculus.
The statistics of the homunculus are in the Monster Manual. It is your faithful companion, and it dies if you die. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can spend up to half your Hit Dice if the homunculus is on the same plane of existence as you. When you do so, roll each die and add your Constitution modifier to it. Your hit point maximum is reduced by the total, and the homunculus's hit point maximum and current hit points are both increased by it. This process can reduce you to no lower than 1 hit point, and the change to your and the homunculus's hit points ends when you finish your next long rest. The reduction to your hit point maximum can't be removed by any means before then, except by the homunculus's death.
You can have only one homunculus at a time. If you cast this spell while your homunculus lives, the spell fails.

You decide whether it is a zombie or a skeleton (the statistics for zombie and skeleton are in the Monster Manual), and it gains a bonus to its attack and damage rolls equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.
You can use a bonus action to mentally command the creatures you make with this spell, issuing the same command to all of them. To receive the command, a creature must be within 60 feet of you. You decide what action the creatures will take and where they will move during their next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a chamber or passageway against your foes. If you issue no commands, the creatures do nothing except defend themselves against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creatures continue to follow it until their task is complete.
The creatures are under your control until the spell ends, after which they become inanimate once more.

    <text>You invoke the spirits of nature to protect an area outdoors or underground. The area can be as small as a 30-foot cube or as large as a 90-foot cube. Buildings and other structures are excluded from the affected area. If you cast this spell in the same area every day for a year, the spell lasts until dispelled.
The spell creates the following effects within the area. When you cast this spell, you can specify creatures as friends who are immune to the effects. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.
The entire warded area radiates magic. A dispel magic cast on the area, if successful, removes only one of the following effects, not the entire area. That spell's caster chooses which effect to end. Only when all its effects are gone is this spell dispelled.
Solid Fog: You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground with thick fog, making them heavily obscured. The fog reaches 10 feet high. In addition, every foot of movement through the fog costs 2 extra feet. To a creature immune to this effect, the fog obscures nothing and looks like soft mist, with motes of green light floating in the air.
Grasping Undergrowth: You can fill any number of 5-foot squares on the ground that aren't filled with fog with grasping weeds and vines, as if they were affected by an entangle spell. To a creature immune to this effect, the weeds and vines feel soft and reshape themselves to serve as temporary seats or beds.
Grove Guardians: You can animate up to four trees in the area, causing them to uproot themselves from the ground. These trees have the same statistics as an awakened tree, which appears in the Monster Manual, except they can't speak, and their bark is covered with druidic symbols. If any creature not immune to this effect enters the warded area, the grove guardians fight until they have driven off or slain the intruders. The grove guardians also obey your spoken commands (no action required by you) that you issue while in the area. If you don't give them commands and no intruders are present, the grove guardians do nothing. The grove guardians can't leave the warded area. When the spell ends, the magic animating them disappears, and the trees take root again if possible.
Additional Spell Effect: You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area:
• A constant gust of wind in two locations of your choice
• Spike growth in one location of your choice
• Wind wall in two locations of your choice
To a creature immune to this effect, the winds are a fragrant, gentle breeze, and the area of spike growth is harmless.

As a bonus action, you can move the dust devil up to 30 feet in any direction.

    <text>You summon a spirit that assumes the form of a loyal, majestic mount. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the spirit takes on a form you choose: a griffon, a pegasus, a peryton, a dire wolf, a rhinoceros, or a saber-toothed tiger. The creature has the statistics provided in the Monster Manual for the chosen form, though it is a celestial, a fey, or a fiend (your choice) instead of its normal creature type. Additionally, if it has an Intelligence score of 5 or lower, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.
You control the mount in combat. While the mount is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. While mounted on it, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target the mount.
The mount disappears temporarily when it drops to 0 hit points or when you dismiss it as an action. Casting this spell again re-summons the bonded mount, with all its hit points restored and any conditions removed.
You can't have more than one mount bonded by this spell or find steed at the same time. As an action, you can release a mount from its bond, causing it to disappear permanently.
Whenever the mount disappears, it leaves behind any objects it was wearing or carrying.

Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirit's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore 1d6 hit points to that creature (no action required).

Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the weapon must make a Constitution saving throw.

At the end of each of its turns, a blinded creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

    <text>By gathering threads of shadow material from the Shadowfell, you create a Huge shadowy dragon in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The illusion lasts for the spell's duration and occupies its space, as if it were a creature.
When the illusion appears, any of your enemies that can see it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute. If a frightened creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to the illusion, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 60 feet. At any point during its movement, you can cause it to exhale a blast of energy in a 60-foot cone originating from its space. When you create the dragon, choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, or poison. Each creature in the cone must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking 7d6 damage of the chosen damage type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
The illusion is tangible because of the shadow stuff used to create it, but attacks miss it automatically, it succeeds on all saving throws, and it is immune to all damage and conditions. A creature that uses an action to examine the dragon can determine that it is an illusion by succeeding on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through it and has advantage on saving throws against its breath.

    <text>Uttering a dark incantation, you summon a devil from the Nine Hells. You choose the devil's type, which must be one of challenge rating 6 or lower, such as a barbed devil or a bearded devil. The devil appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The devil disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
The devil is unfriendly toward you and your companions. Roll initiative for the devil, which has its own turns. It is under the Dungeon Master's control and acts according to its nature on each of its turns, which might result in its attacking you if it thinks it can prevail, or trying to tempt you to undertake an evil act in exchange for limited service. The DM has the creature's statistics.
On each of your turns, you can try to issue a verbal command to the devil (no action required by you). It obeys the command if the likely outcome is in accordance with its desires, especially if the result would draw you toward evil. Otherwise, you must make a Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check contested by its Wisdom (Insight) check. You make the check with advantage if you say the devil's true name. If your check fails, the devil becomes immune to your verbal commands for the duration of the spell, though it can still carry out your commands if it chooses. If your check succeeds, the devil carries out your command—such as "attack my enemies," "explore the room ahead," or "bear this message to the queen"—until it completes the activity, at which point it returns to you to report having done so.
If your concentration ends before the spell reaches its full duration, the devil doesn't disappear if it has become immune to your verbal commands. Instead, it acts in whatever manner it chooses for 3d6 minutes, and then it disappears.
If you possess an individual devil's talisman, you can summon that devil if it is of the appropriate challenge rating plus 1, and it obeys all your commands, with no Charisma checks required.
At Higher Levels:
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.

On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Whether the attack hits or misses, the spell then ends on the stone.
If you cast this spell again, the spell ends on any pebbles still affected by your previous casting.

    <text>You transform up to ten creatures of your choice that you can see within range. An unwilling target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to resist the transformation. An unwilling shapechanger automatically succeeds on the save.
Each target assumes a beast form of your choice, and you can choose the same form or different ones for each target. The new form can be any beast you have seen whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or half the target's level, if the target doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, but the target retains its hit points, alignment, and personality.
Each target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the hit points of its new form. These temporary hit points can't be replaced by temporary hit points from another source. A target reverts to its normal form when it has no more temporary hit points or it dies. If the spell ends before then, the creature loses all its temporary hit points and reverts to its normal form.
The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form. It can't speak, cast spells, or do anything else that requires hands or speech.
The target's gear melds into the new form. The target can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the restrained target, which must make a Strength saving throw. The target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
To break out, the restrained target can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer restrained by the hand.
As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a restrained target if you do either.

    <text>A fortress of stone erupts from a square area of ground of your choice that you can see within range. The area is 120 feet on each side, and it must not have any buildings or other structures on it. Any creatures in the area are harmlessly lifted up as the fortress rises.
The fortress has four turrets with square bases, each one 20 feet on a side and 30 feet tall, with one turret on each corner. The turrets are connected to each other by stone walls that are each 80 feet long, creating an enclosed area. Each wall is 1 foot thick and is composed of panels that are 10 feet wide and 20 feet tall. Each panel is contiguous with two other panels or one other panel and a turret. You can place up to four stone doors in the fortress's outer wall.
A small keep stands inside the enclosed area. The keep has a square base that is 50 feet on each side, and it has three floors with 10-foot-high ceilings. Each of the floors can be divided into as many rooms as you like, provided each room is at least 5 feet on each side. The floors of the keep are connected by stone staircases, its walls are 6 inches thick, and interior rooms can have stone doors or open archways as you choose. The keep is furnished and decorated however you like, and it contains sufficient food to serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people each day. Furnishings, food, and other objects created by this spell crumble to dust if removed from the fortress.
A staff of one hundred invisible servants obeys any command given to them by creatures you designate when you cast the spell. Each servant functions as if created by the unseen servant spell.
The walls, turrets, and keep are all made of stone that can be damaged. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of stone has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. It is immune to poison and psychic damage. Reducing a section of stone to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected sections to buckle and collapse at the DM's discretion.
After 7 days or when you cast this spell somewhere else, the fortress harmlessly crumbles and sinks back into the ground, leaving any creatures that were inside it safely on the ground.
Casting this spell on the same spot once every 7 days for a year makes the fortress permanent.

• You cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.

While the target is affected by crippling pain, any speed it has can be no higher than 10 feet. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, other than Constitution saving throws. Finally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted.
A target suffering this pain can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the pain ends.

    <duration>8 hours</duration>
    <text>This spell snatches the soul of a humanoid as it dies and traps it inside the tiny cage you use for the material component. A stolen soul remains inside the cage until the spell ends or until you destroy the cage, which ends the spell. While you have a soul inside the cage, you can exploit it in any of the ways described below. You can use a trapped soul up to six times. Once you exploit a soul for the sixth time, it is released, and the spell ends. While a soul is trapped, the dead humanoid it came from can't be revived.
Steal Life: You can use a bonus action to drain vigor from the soul and regain 2d8 hit points.
Query Soul: You ask the soul a question (no action required) and receive a brief telepathic answer, which you can understand regardless of the language used. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.
Borrow Experience: You can use a bonus action to bolster yourself with the soul's life experience, making your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage. If you don't use this benefit before the start of your next turn, it is lost.
Eyes of the Dead: You can use an action to name a place the humanoid saw in life, which creates an invisible sensor somewhere in that place if it is on the plane of existence you're currently on. The sensor remains for as long as you concentrate, up to 10 minutes (as if you were concentrating on a spell). You receive visual and auditory information from the sensor as if you were in its space using your senses.
A creature that can see the sensor (such as one using see invisibility or truesight) sees a translucent image of the tormented humanoid whose soul you caged.

    <text>You utter foul words, summoning one demon from the chaos of the Abyss. You choose the demon's type, which must be one of challenge rating 5 or lower, such as a shadow demon or a barlgura. The demon appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range, and the demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
Roll initiative for the demon, which has its own turns. When you summon it and on each of your turns thereafter, you can issue a verbal command to it (requiring no action on your part), telling it what it must do on its next turn. If you issue no command, it spends its turn attacking any creature within reach that has attacked it.
At the end of each of the demon's turns, it makes a Charisma saving throw. The demon has disadvantage on this saving throw if you say its true name. On a failed save, the demon continues to obey you. On a successful save, your control of the demon ends for the rest of the duration, and the demon spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest non-demons to the best of its ability. If you stop concentrating on the spell before it reaches its full duration, an uncontrolled demon doesn't disappear for 1d6 rounds if it still has hit points.
As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle on the ground with the blood used as a material component. The circle is large enough to encompass your space. While the spell lasts, the summoned demon can't cross the circle or harm it, and it can't target anyone within it. Using the material component in this manner consumes it when the spell ends.

The DM chooses the demons, such as manes or dretch, and you choose the unoccupied spaces you can see within range where they appear. A summoned demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.
The demons are hostile to all creatures, including you. Roll initiative for the summoned demons as a group, which has its own turns. The demons pursue and attack the nearest non-demons to the best of their ability.

    <text>You cause a temple to shimmer into existence on ground you can see within range. The temple must fit within an unoccupied cube of space, up to 120 feet on each side. The temple remains until the spell ends. It is dedicated to whatever god, pantheon, or philosophy is represented by the holy symbol used in the casting.
You make all decisions about the temple's appearance. The interior is enclosed by a floor, walls, and a roof, with one door granting access to the interior and as many windows as you wish. Only you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open or close the door.
The temple's interior is an open space with an idol or altar at one end. You decide whether the temple is illuminated and whether that illumination is bright light or dim light. The smell of burning incense fills the air within, and the temperature is mild.
The temple opposes types of creatures you choose when you cast this spell. Choose one or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. If a creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, that creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it can't enter the temple for 24 hours. Even if the creature can enter the temple, the magic there hinders it; whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw inside the temple, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the d20 roll.
In addition, the sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the temple, and creatures within can't be targeted by divination spells.
Finally, whenever any creature in the temple regains hit points from a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature regains additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 hit point).
The temple is made from opaque magical force that extends into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temple's interior. Nothing can physically pass through the temple's exterior. It can't be dispelled by dispel magic, and antimagic field has no effect on it. A disintegrate spell destroys the temple instantly.
Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.

As a bonus action, you can mentally command the creature if it is within 120 feet of you. (If you control multiple creatures with this spell, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a simple, general command, such as to fetch a key, stand watch, or stack some books. If you issue no commands, the servant does nothing other than defend itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the servant continues to follow that order until its task is complete.

Transmute Rock to Mud: Nonmagical rock of any sort in the area becomes an equal volume of thick, flowing mud that remains for the spell's duration.
The ground in the spell's area becomes muddy enough that creatures can sink into it. Each foot that a creature moves through the mud costs 4 feet of movement, and any creature on the ground when you cast the spell must make a Strength saving throw. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. On a failed save, a creature sinks into the mud and is restrained, though it can use an action to end the restrained condition on itself by pulling itself free of the mud.
If you cast the spell on a ceiling, the mud falls. Any creature under the mud when it falls must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Transmute Mud to Rock: Nonmagical mud or quicksand in the area no more than 10 feet deep transforms into soft stone for the spell's duration. Any creature in the mud when it transforms must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is shunted safely to the surface in an unoccupied space. On a failed save, a creature becomes restrained by the rock. A restrained creature, or another creature within reach, can use an action to try to break the rock by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength check or by dealing damage to it. The rock has AC 15 and 25 hit points, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.

The wall blocks line of sight, but creatures and objects can pass through it. It emits bright light out to 120 feet and dim light for an additional 120 feet.

A blinded creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
A creature that ends its turn in the wall's area takes 4d8 radiant damage.
Until the spell ends, you can use an action to launch a beam of radiance from the wall at one creature you can see within 60 feet of it. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 radiant damage. Whether you hit or miss, reduce the length of the wall by 10 feet. If the wall's length drops to 0 feet, the spell ends.

    <text>You create a wall of water on the ground at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or you can make a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall vanishes when the spell ends. The wall's space is difficult terrain.
Any ranged weapon attack that enters the wall's space has disadvantage on the attack roll, and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall to reach its target. Spells that deal cold damage that pass through the wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at least a 5-foot-square section is frozen). Each 5-foot-square frozen section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall's water doesn't fill it.

The wind has the following effects:
• It deafened you and other creatures in its area.
• It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller.
• It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind.
• The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you.

    <text>You conjure up a sphere of water with a 5-foot radius at a point you can see within range. The sphere can hover but no more than 10 feet off the ground. The sphere remains for the spell's duration.
Any creature in the sphere's space must make a Strength saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied space of the creature's choice outside the sphere. A Huge or larger creature succeeds on the saving throw automatically, and a Large or smaller creature can choose to fail it. On a failed save, a creature is restrained by the sphere and is engulfed by the water. At the end of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
The sphere can restrain as many as four Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature. If the sphere restrains a creature that causes it to exceed this capacity, a random creature that was already restrained by the sphere falls out of it and lands prone in a space within 5 feet of it.
As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in a straight line. If it moves over a pit, a cliff, or other drop-off, it safely descends until it is hovering 10 feet above the ground. Any creature restrained by the sphere moves with it. You can ram the sphere into creatures, forcing them to make the saving throw.
When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all normal flames within 30 feet of it. Any creature restrained by the sphere is knocked prone in the space where it falls. The water then vanishes.

    <text>A whirlwind howls down to a point that you can see on the ground within range. The whirlwind is a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Until the spell ends, you can use your action to move the whirlwind up to 30 feet in any direction along the ground. The whirlwind sucks up any Medium or smaller objects that aren't secured to anything and that aren't worn or carried by anyone.
A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw the first time on a turn that it enters the whirlwind or that the whirlwind enters its space, including when the whirlwind first appears. A creature takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature that fails the save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained in the whirlwind until the spell ends. When a creature starts its turn restrained by the whirlwind, the creature is pulled 5 feet higher inside it, unless the creature is at the top. A restrained creature moves with the whirlwind and falls when the spell ends, unless the creature has some means to stay aloft.
A restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check against your spell save DC. If successful, the creature is no longer restrained by the whirlwind and is hurled 3d6 x 10 feet away from it in a random direction.

Grasses and Undergrowth: Any area of ground in the cube that is covered by grass or undergrowth is difficult terrain for your enemies.
Trees: At the start of each of your turns, each of your enemies within 10 feet of any tree in the cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 slashing damage from whipping branches.
Roots and Vines: At the end of each of your turns, one creature of your choice that is on the ground in the cube must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained until the spell ends.

Rocks: As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause a loose rock in the cube to launch at a creature you can see in the cube. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 nonmagical bludgeoning damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone.

The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the creature is charmed in this way, it undertakes to perform any services or activities you ask of it in a friendly manner, to the best of its ability.
You can set the creature new tasks when a previous task is completed, or if you decide to end its current task. If the service or activity might cause harm to the creature, or if it conflicts with the creature's normal activities and desires, the creature can make another Wisdom saving throw to try to end the effect. This save is made with advantage if you or your companions are fighting the creature. If the activity would result in certain death for the creature, the spell ends.

Jim Darkmagic is said to have invented this spell, originally calling it I said what?! Have you ever been talking to the local monarch and accidentally mentioned how their son looks like your favorite hog from when you were growing up on the family farm? We've all been there! But rather than being beheaded for an honest slip of the tongue, you can pretend it never happened—by ensuring that no one knows it happened.
When you cast this spell, you skillfully reshape the memories of listeners in your immediate area, so that each creature of your choice within 5 feet of you forgets everything you said within the last 6 seconds. Those creatures then remember that you actually said the words you speak as the verbal component of the spell.

Any apprentice wizard can cast a boring old magic missile. Sure, it always strikes its target. Yawn. Do away with the drudgery of your grandfather's magic with this improved version of the spell, as used by Jim Darkmagic!
You create three twisting, whistling, hypoallergenic, gluten-free darts of magical force. Each dart targets a creature of your choice that you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack for each missile. On a hit, a missile deals 2d4 force damage to its target.
If the attack roll scores a critical hit, the target of that missile takes 5d4 force damage instead of you rolling damage twice for a critical hit. If the attack roll for any missile is a 1, all missiles miss their targets and blow up in your face, dealing 1 force damage per missile to you.

Choose up to five creatures within range that can hear you. For the duration, each affected creature gains 5 temporary hit points and has advantage on Wisdom saving throws.

For the duration, the spell's area is difficult terrain. A creature with darkvision can't see through the magical darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. No sound can be created within or pass through the area. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.
Any creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 8d10 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust.

    <text>You create intense pressure, unleash it in a 30-foot cone, and decide whether the pressure pulls or pushes creatures and objects. Each creature in that cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. And every creature that fails the save is either pulled 15 feet toward you or pushed 15 feet away from you, depending on the choice you made for the spell.
In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the cone are likewise pulled or pushed 15 feet.
At Higher Levels:
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 and the distance pulled or pushed increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.

    <text>You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of destructive gravitational force centered on a point you can see within range. For the spell's duration, the sphere and any space within 100 feet of it are difficult terrain, and nonmagical objects fully inside the sphere are destroyed if they aren't being worn or carried.
When the sphere appears and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends, unsecured objects within 100 feet of the sphere are pulled toward the sphere's center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible.
A creature that starts its turn within 100 feet of the sphere must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled straight toward the sphere's center, ending in an unoccupied space as close to the center as possible. A creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 5d10 force damage and is restrained until it is no longer in the sphere. If the sphere is in the air, the restrained creature hovers inside the sphere. A creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, ending this restrained condition on itself or another creature in the sphere that it can reach. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell is annihilated, along with any nonmagical items it is wearing or carrying.

    <text>You shatter the barriers between realities and timelines, thrusting a creature into turmoil and madness. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it can't take reactions until the spell ends. The affected target must also roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns; the number rolled determines what happens to the target, as shown on the Reality Break Effects table.
At the end of each of its turns, the affected target can repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the spell on itself on a success.
Reality Break Effects
d10 | Effect
1-2 | Vision of the Far Realm. The target takes 6d12 psychic damage, and it is stunned until the end of the turn.
3-5 | Rending Rift. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d12 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
6-8 | Wormhole. The target is teleported, along with everything it is wearing and carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see. The target also takes 10d12 force damage and is knocked prone.
9-10 | Chill of the Dark Void. The target takes 10d12 cold damage, and it is blinded until the end of the turn.

At Higher Levels:
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 5th. All targets must be within 30 feet of each other.

    <text>Two creatures you can see within range must make a Constitution saving throw, with disadvantage if they are within 30 feet of each other. Either creature can willingly fail the save. If either save succeeds, the spell has no effect. If both saves fail, the creatures are magically linked for the duration, regardless of the distance between them. When damage is dealt to one of them, the same damage is dealt to the other one. If hit points are restored to one of them, the same number of hit points are restored to the other one. If either of the tethered creatures is reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends on both. If the spell ends on one creature, it ends on both.

    <text>You target a creature you can see within range, putting its physical form through the devastation of rapid aging. The target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the save fails, the target also ages to the point where it has only 30 days left before it dies of old age. In this aged state, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, and its walking speed is halved. Only the wish spell or the greater restoration cast with a 9th-level spell slot can end these effects and restore the target to its previous age.

Until the spell ends, you can use your action to summon the object to your free hand, and you can use your action to return the object to the extradimensional space. An object still in the pocket plane when the spell ends appears in your space, at your feet.

  <text>Fortifying (1+ psi points): The target gains an extra 1d6 temporary hit points for each point spent.</text>
  <text>Resilient (3 psi points): The target gains resistance to all damage until the start of your next turn.</text>
  <text>Savage (1+ psi points): The target’s next weapon attack deals 1d6 additional damage for each point spent.</text>
  <text>Swift (2 psi points): The target gains an additional action. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.</text>

It can’t be larger than 3 feet on any side or weigh more than 10 pounds, and is clearly ethereal in nature. The item behaves as a solid object.

  <duration>Concentration, up to 1 minute</duration>
  <text>You project an ethereal creation from your mind at a space you can see within range, taking the shape of a Medium or smaller creature, weapon, or other object. This creation is clearly ethereal in nature. When you create it, and on subsequent turns using your action to mentally control it, you can move it up to 30 feet in any direction and attack, so long as it doesn’t move beyond the range of the power. To attack with it, make a melee spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage. If the Astral Construct moves out of range of the spell, it fades away into nothing, ending the spell.</text>
  <text>While the Astral Construct is active, you can spend psi points up to your per use limit to issue commands that affect and empower your construct. Commands require no action, but you can’t exceed your psi point limit in total commands issued, and each command can only be issued once per turn.</text>
  <text>Grab (1 psi point): Can only be used while your construct is Solidified. A target creature within 5 feet of your construct that is no more than one size larger than the construct must make a Strength saving throw or become restrained by the construct. At the end of each of the restrained creature’s turns it can repeat the saving throw. The condition ends if the construct becomes ethereal again, or becomes more than one size smaller than the target.</text>
  <text>Grow (1 psi point): Your construct increases by one size, and its number of damage dice increases by one. It returns to its normal size at the start of your next turn. It can only gain one additional die (for example, up to 2d8)</text>
  <text>Relocate (1 psi point): The construct disappears and reappears anywhere within 60 feet of you.</text>
  <text>Replicate (3 psi points): You use Relocate, but the original doesn’t disappear. Until the end of your turn, you have another construct and control both with the same action (commands only affect one of your choice). Pick one construct to fade at the start of your next turn or use Sustain.</text>
  <text>Solidify (1 psi point): Your construct becomes solid, blocking its space until the start of your next turn. You can only use this command if it is in an unoccupied space. It has an armor class of 16 and hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier + your psion level. The construct becomes ethereal again if it drops to zero hit points.</text>
  <text>Strike (2 psi points): The construct makes an attack (even if it has already attacked).</text>
  <text>Sustain (1+ psi points): At the start of your turn, you can sustain the effect of a Solidify, Grow or Replicate command for an additional round. An effect that has been replicated can be sustained across all replicated constructs with a single use, but each effect can only be sustained once per turn (for example, you can never sustain more than one replicated construct). This costs 1 psi point for each effect sustained. Sustaining Solidify refreshes the construct’s hit points to its maximum.</text>

  <text>You assault the mind of a target you can see within range, rending and devouring its psionic energy. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage. If the target is frightened, charmed, stunned, restrained, grappled, or paralyzed, the psychic damage becomes 1d12 instead. On a failed save, you gain a psionic charge of consumed power until the end of your next turn.

  <text>Shredding (1 psi point): You leave the target’s mind and soul shredded, reducing their next saving throw before the end of your next turn by 1d4.</text>
  <text>Stunning (3 psi points): On a failed saving throw, the target becomes stunned until the start of your next turn. If the power affects multiple targets, select one target for this effect.</text>
  <text>Thieving (1 psi point): On a failed saving throw, you can draw a 5th level or lower spell the target can cast from its mind (from a Spellcasting or Psionics feature). You must be aware that it can cast that spell; the target retains the ability to cast the spell, but you gain the ability to cast the spell using your Psionics feature by spending psi points equal to the level of the spell (restricted by your psi point limit; you can’t use Psionic Mastery to cast this spell).</text>
  <text>You can know one spell in this manner at a time, and retain the ability to cast the spell for 1 minute or until cast. If the spell is one that restores hit points, you reduce your own hit points by the amount healed by the spell.</text>
