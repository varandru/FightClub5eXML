      <text>Centaurs have a tendency toward good. As a tribal people, they don’t lean toward the freedom of a chaotic alignment, but they don’t obey laws that they feel are unjust or ineffective. They lean toward neutral.</text>

      <text>Medusae are not born—they are made. When a humanoid is afflicted by the curse of the medusa, they gradually transform into a snake-haired monstrosity. Once transformed, they may live for a thousand years, but most are hunted down and killed long before then.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Alignment</name>
      <text>Civilized medusae tend toward neutral or lawful evil alignments, because they must find ways to survive on the fringes of society. They must be careful to cooperate with others who will suffer the company of one who is cursed by the gods. Medusae who give into their anger eventually lose control of themselves and become true monsters.</text>

On a failure, the creature is paralyzed until the end of its next turn. On your turn, you can use your bonus action to force the same creature to repeat this saving throw with disadvantage. Each time it fails, it is paralyzed again until the end of its next turn. When a creature is paralyzed in this way for the third time in a span of 10 minutes, it is instantly petrified.</text>

        <text>Some individuals are born with seemingly impossible strength, exhibiting rippling muscles even before they learn to speak or walk. Such men and women quickly learn that every good thing in this world may be obtained through the exercise of overwhelming might. Others may scorn them and call them “barbaric,” but what are words but useless noise to be choked out of the speaker’s windpipe?</text>
        <text>As one such individual, you know that strength is what determines one’s worth in the world: strength to crush your enemies—and to impress your allies. You savor the opportunity to show off your great strength, whether it be in battle or in friendly competition.

You are proficient in the Athletics skill, and you are capable of grappling and shoving creatures that are up to two sizes larger than you.

Additionally, you may choose to use your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls with longbows. When you make ranged attacks with longbows or thrown weapons while raging, you may add your rage damage bonus to the damage rolls.</text>
        <text>If a spell requires concentration, it uses your concentration as normal.</text>

        <text>Each creature on the ground in the affected area that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. On a failed save, the creature's concentration is broken. At the end of your turn, each creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw with the same DC as the previous one. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone. You have advantage on this saving throw.</text>

        <name>Sacred Oath: Oath of the Dragonlord</name>
        <text>Dragonlords are paladins who seek to extend their reach across the land by binding a dragon into their service. Such a task should never be undertaken lightly. Forming a true bond with a dragon requires a paladin to hatch a dragon egg and raise the wyrmling from the first moment it draws breath. Raising a dragon in this way requires the paladin to lay their life on the line by swearing an oath. This oath creates a reciprocal bond between the paladin’s soul and the soul of the dragon.</text>
        <text>But finding a dragon egg is no easy task either. For this reason, Dragonlords summon pseudodragon familiars and train them to seek out the perfect egg. This process may take years, and many paladins come to view the pseudodragon as a partner in the oath. When an egg is finally discovered, the paladin and the pseudodragon may share an almost parental pride in the hatchling.</text>
        <text>Once the paladin’s dragon is grown, its master becomes a true Dragonlord. But the paladin is as much a servant to the dragon as the dragon is to its master. The two are one—their destinies are interlinked—and whatsoever pain is suffered by one is also felt by the other.</text>

        <name>Oath of the Dragonlord: Pseudodragon Familiar</name>
        <text>When you cast the find familiar spell, you summon a pseudodragon instead of one of the normal forms described in the spell. The pseudodragon's primary purpose is to find you a dragon egg. The pseudodragon can smell dragon eggs if they are within one mile.</text>
        <text>The pseudodragon is likely to find a dragon egg by the time you are 5th level, but it might be earlier. If your pseudodragon hasn’t found a dragon egg by 6th level, then it departs in search of one. In 3d6 days, the pseudodragon returns to you with a dragon egg of your choice from this list: brass, bronze, copper, or silver.</text>
        <text>If at any time your dragon egg is lost or destroyed, your pseudodragon will depart in search of another one. It will return in 3d6 days with the lost egg or a suitable replacement. If you deliberately lose or destroy your egg, then your pseudodragon refuses to perform this service.</text>

        <text>Dragon’s Wrath. As an action, you can mimic the frightful presence of a dragon, using your Channel Divinity. You issue a roar as loud as an adult dragon. Each creature of your choice that is within 60 ft. of you and aware of you must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</text>
        <text>Scorn the Unworthy. Your dragonlord oath elevates you above the multitudes of the corrupt and the weak. As an action, you can intone the Dragonlord’s oath, using your Channel Divinity. Enemy creatures within 30 feet that are Large or smaller in size must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature falls prone and loses concentration on any spells that it has active.</text>

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Oath of the Dragonlord: Dragonlord’s Bond</name>
        <text>At 7th level, your dragon egg will hatch. You must cast the spell bond of the dragonlords while touching the newborn wyrmling within 24 hours of it hatching. The dragon wyrmling is now bonded to you. Additionally, you may cast the spells bond of the dragonlords and dirge of the dragonlords, and they require no material components when you cast them. Your wyrmling has hit points equal to 40 + twice your paladin level, and it adds your proficiency bonus to its saving throws</text>

        <text>By 15th level, your dragon grows into a young dragon of the appropriate type if five years have not yet passed since its hatching. The dragon will now allow itself to be used as a mount. In addition, while mounted on a dragon, you gain that dragon’s damage resistances, damage immunities, and senses (blindsight, darkvision, and its passive Perception if it is greater than yours).</text>

Your dragon gains access to its Multiattack feature, and its breath weapon now recharges using the normal rules each round instead of using the restriction outlined in bond of the dragonlords.</text>
