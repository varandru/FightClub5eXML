      <name>Description</name>
      <text>Once, the gods, in the form of men, walked upon the earth and blessed it. They climbed mountains in passing, and waded kraken filled seas in their baths. Once. These legends circle and grow around mountain fires, on snow-streaked ridges and barren arctic wastelands, fires that warm the chilled skin of a people who are but a shell of their ancestors: the giants, who now weep and shiver in their graves and halls. These people are all that are left of the great striders of the world.</text>

    <trait>
      <name>Age</name>
      <text>The age of any goliath is an unpredictable variable. Due to the harsh climate and general danger, goliaths over 100 are rare, but it is conceivable a sustained goliath could live for a handful of centuries. They enter real adulthood in their late twenties, but are often considered mature mentally by their earlier twenties.

      <name>Alignment</name>
