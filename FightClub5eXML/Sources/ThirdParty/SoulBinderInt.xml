        <name>Soul Bond</name>
        <text>TAt 1st level, you have chosen to sacrifice a piece of your own soul to gain the aid of a creature stronger than you. You can choose one of several bonds detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you additional features when you reach 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th and 15th levels.</text>

        <name>Bonded Companion</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you gain a companion that will serve and aid you in every way it possibly can. The companion gains bonuses from being linked to your essence. In combat, the companion moves and acts on your turn in initiative. You can command it verbally (no action needed) and if you are incapacitated, it will do its best to protect you and itself from harm.</text>
        <text>You and your companion both become empowered from the bond you share, but only one of you can take full advantage of that power at first. If you take the Attack action or cast a spell with a casting time of one action, your companion can't take the Attack action on the same turn, and if your companion takes the Attack action, you can't take the Attack action or cast a spell with a casting time of one action on the same turn.</text>
        <text>More details about your companion can be found in the "Soulbound Traits" feature.</text>
      </feature>
    </autolevel>
    <autolevel level="1">
      <feature>
        <name>Soulbound Traits</name>
        <text>Your soulbound companion has its own hit dice, and can spend them during a short rest. At first level, its hit points are equal to the maximum value of its hit dice + its Constitution modifier. Whenever you gain a level in this class, your companion also levels up, and it can increase its hit point maximum using its hit dice as normal.</text>
        <text>Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature in this class, your companion's abilities also improve. You can increase one of its ability scores of your choice by 2, or you can increase two of its ability scores of your choice by 1. At the DM's discretion you can forgo increasing the companion's ability scores and instead take one feat of your choice for it. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature unless its description specifies otherwise.</text>
        <text>Your companion aids you in and out of battle, as it gains bonuses for being linked to your essence. It gains proficiency in two skills of your choice. In areas where it would use its proficiency bonus, it uses your proficiency bonus instead. It also uses your proficiency bonus when calculating its AC</text>
        <text>Your companion will always use Strength for its attack and damage rolls (unless otherwise specified), and its damage dice is shown in the companion's stat block. If a feature for your companion requires another creature to make a saving throw, the DC is equal to your Spell Save DC.</text>
        <text>If your companion is reduced to 0 hit points, it falls unconscious and makes death saving throws. When it is reduced to 0 hit points, the soul binder will take any excess damage from the attack. If it is killed, you can return it to life as part of a long rest. The process of reviving can be very hard on your soul, gaining one level of exhaustion at the end of the rest when you revive your companion.</text>
        <text>If you die your companion will gain 1 level of exhaustion for each minute you are dead until you are revived again or the companion dies too.</text>

If there isn't enough space for it to grow to its original size, it instead takes 1d10 force damage and stays Tiny. While in Tiny form, the companion can't attack in any way</text>

        <name>Hidden Form: Pocket Dimension</name>

As an action, while it is dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. If you go unconscious while your companion is in its pocket dimension, it reappears within 5 feet on you.</text>

        <text>You have gotten better control over your companion and can give it more complicated commands. You can use a bonus action to speak a command to your companion. It must be able to hear you for the command to take effect.</text>
        <text>At 2nd level, you learn the following commands: Strike, Toughen Up, Block, Move. They are available as Soul Binder Edict spells</text>
        <text>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), regaining all uses on a long rest.</text>
        <text>The amount of dice for the "Strike" and "Toughen Up" edict increase as you gain levels in this class, increasing to 3d6 at 5th level, 4d6 at 11th level and 5d6 at 17th level.</text>

        <text>By 2nd level, you are now more used to being bonded to a magical creature, and have started to be able to use some magic to help your allies or bolster your companion. See Chapter 10 in the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and Chapter 11 for the soul binder spell list.</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>Cantrips:</text>
        <text>   At 2nd level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the soul binder spell list. You learn an additional soul binder cantrip of your choice at 4th level and another at 10th level</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>Preparing and Casting Spells:</text>
        <text>   The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text>   The Soul Binder table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your soul binder spells. To cast one of your soul binder spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest</text>
        <text>   You prepare the list of soul binder spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the soul binder spell list. When you do so, choose a number of soul binder spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your soul binder level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
        <text>   For example, if you are a 5th-level soul binder, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell heroism, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</text>
        <text>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of soul binder spells requires time spent in meditation with your companion: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
        <text>   Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your soul binder spells, since the power of your magic relies on you being able to communicate with your companion and the bond that you share. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a soul binder spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>Spellcasting Focus:</text>
        <text>   You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your soul binder spells.</text>

      <feature>
        <name>Magic Item Absorption</name>
        <text>When you reach 3rd level, the soul binder can perform a special ritual to merge a magic item into its companion during a short rest. Merging with an item requires physical contact between the soul binder, the item and the companion.</text>
        <text>Certain items have prerequisites. The companion must meet any prerequisite for the item to successfully merge with it. Your companion cannot merge with items requiring a class prerequisite. If the short rest is interrupted, the merging fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the item merges into the companion.</text>
        <text>While merged, the companion gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary Command words. Your companion can use the magical properties of the item and apply the effects to its natural weapons and natural armor, but doesn't get the benefit of the armor or weapon itself. It can only have one weapon merged at a time, and one piece of armor. The companions natural weapons can only benefit from one of the merged items, and you can change this on a short rest, the same goes for it's natural armor. If it absorbs a weapon, its attacks becomes magical</text>
        <text>Example: if you bind a +1 Plate armor to your companion it gains +1 to its AC, but not the benefits of wearing Plate armor. Each merged item within the creature counts as an attunement for the soul binder, regardless if whether the item required attunement. Attempting to merge with more than three items fails automatically. The soul binder can voluntarily end the merge by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed. If the companion dies, all the merges items are expelled from its corpse on the ground around it.</text>
