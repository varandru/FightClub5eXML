        <text>As a practioner of occult magic, you have inherited and developed techniques to manipulate reality through mediums of rituals, spirits, elements, and more. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the Occultist spell list.</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>Cantrips:</text>
        <text>   At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Occultist spell list. You learn additional Occultist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Occultist table.</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>Spell Slots:</text>
        <text>   The Occultist table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Occultist spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text>   For example, if you know the 1st-level spell witchbolt and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast witchbolt using either slot.</text>
        <text>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</text>
        <text>   You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the Occultist spell list.</text>
        <text>   The Spells Known column of the Occultist table shows when you learn more Occultist spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
        <text>   Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Occultist spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Occultist spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>
        <text>Spellcasting Ability:</text>
        <text>   Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>Ritual Casting:</text>
        <text>   You can cast any Occultist spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</text>

        <text>Spellcasting Focus:</text>

Any occultist spell you know of 3rd level or lower becomes a ritual spell for you.

        <text>Additionally, your mastery of rituals allows you to work them more quickly, and a spell only takes additional turns equal to the spells level to cast (for example, casting a 3rd level spell as a ritual would take fours turns to cast, casting as your action or bonus action on the fourth turn). Spells with a casting time of a reaction cannot be cast as a ritual.</text>

        <name>Occult Tradition: Tradition of the Oracle</name>
        <text>An oracle is an occultists whose power comes to them from their connection to fate; bound and empowered oracles carry some piece of divine mystery within them, tied to an aspect of destiny and fate. As their power grows they begin to understand this mystery with revelations, unlocking its secrets and the power they contain.</text>
        <text>An oracle typically does not directly serve a god, rather they often are people who's fate has entangled them in the affairs of the gods. Oracles have great power, but their powers are not ones that mortals were meant to have, and consequently they are frequently burdened by their powers.</text>
        <text>The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their Oracle with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</text>

        <text>Additionally, the touch of divine revelation has opened new pathways of magic that lie beyond the mortal grasp. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a occultist cantrip or a occultist spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the cleric spell list or the occultist spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a occultist spell for you.</text>

        <text>Frequently, the burden of the divine mysteries an oracle touches are too great for their mortal body to bear, and they suffer backlash in the form of curses. These take the form of optional character flaws.</text>
        <text>As these are a part of your power, they can only be removed by the Wish spell, by Remove Curse cast at the 9th level, or a divine being, but if removed you may also lose your associated boon.</text>

        <text>Additionally, when you divine the future with augury, you can issue a cryptic prophecy, with three specific points for rolls that may occur within the next 30 minutes. For each specific point you prophesize, if you specify only the type of roll (for example, an attack, a Strength (Athletics) check, or an initiative roll, etc), a d4 is reserved (example "someone will be particularly quick when rolling initiative").</text>
        <text>If you specify a specific action and a specific person, a d6 is reserved (for example, "when the wizard Caius rolls for initiative, he will be unusually quick"). If you give it a specific unlikely condition, a d8 can be reserved at the discretion of the DM.</text>
        <text>A specific action or person can only have one prophesized event. If that prophesized event takes place (at the discretion of the DM it has occurred), the oracle can spend the reserved die and add it to the roll; if multiple events trigger the prophecy, the oracle can select which of them is effected by the reserved die.</text>

You can release a spirit early as an action, and it is immediately released if you call another spirit.</text>
        <text>While a spirit is bonded to you it strengthens your melee weapon attacks, causing them to deal an additional 1d4 damage of the spirit's type.</text>
        <text>As a bonus action while it is bonded, you can manifest the spirit within 30 feet of you. The spirit is medium sized but spectral in nature while manifested. While the spirit is manifested, whenever you take the attack action you may replace any number of attacks you could normally take with melee spell attacks from your bonded spirit. Melee spell attacks done by the spirit deal 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier damage of the same spirit's type on a hit.

        <text>Some may live openly as what they are, while others may be the last person the superstitious villagers might expect. Varied in their powers, designs, and traditions based on their Coven, generalizing about a Witch is challenging, but they are most often defined by the varied utilitarian magic, hexes that make crossing them unwise, and powerful intelligent familiars.</text>

        <text> Witch of the Black Coven specializes in inflicting pain, curses, and eventual agonizing death to those that cross her, a Witch of the White Coven focuses on binding and healing, and the focus of a Witch of the Green coven is the closest to the Witch's roots in Hag-like fey magic, drawing power from nature to baffle her foes and control her surroundings.</text>

    <text>As part of casting the spell when the creature fails the save, and on subsequent turns using your action until the spell ends, you can perform one of the following actions:</text>
    <text>Hold the doll still, causing the creature to be Restrained until start of your next turn.</text>
    <text>Force the doll to move, causing the creature to move 15 feet in a direction of your choice that it can move.</text>
    <text>Smash the doll, causing it take 4d6 bludgeoning damage.</text>
    <text>Rip the doll in half, ending the spell, destroying the doll, and dealing 4d12 necrotic damage.</text>
    <text>Each time after the first you use an action to manipulate the doll, after the effect takes place, the creature can repeat the Charisma with disadvantage, ending the effect on a successful save.</text>
    <text>Once a creature has been targeted by this spell, they cannot be targeted again for 24 hours.</text>
    <text>At Higher Levels. When cast with a 5th level spell slot or above, the range of the spell becomes unlimited, as long as the target is on the same plane as the caster.</text>

    <text>A vertical column of spiders begins to rain down in 20 foot radius, 40 foot high cylinder, centered on a location you specify. A Swarm of Spiders (Monster Manual, pg 334) descends onto each creature within the cylinder when the spell is cast.</text>
    <text>This swarm is considered to be climbing on the target creature and moves with it, even if they leave the affected area, and takes its turn immediately after that creature's turn. A creature can make use its action to attempt to get it off, making a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the spell save DC of the caster.</text>
    <text>A swarm will attack the creature it fell on if it can, or move to chase it if it has been knocked off of it. Any spiders that remain when the spell ends disappear.</text>

    <text>You cast a curse targeting two individuals. Both targets must make a Charisma saving throw (which they can choose to fail). If both targets fail their saving throws, for the duration of the spell their souls are swapped. A soul controls the body it inhabits. It gains any ability score or action the body had (besides legendary actions or legendary resistance), but retains it's own spell casting (if it has the spellcasting, innate or otherwise), and has disadvantage on all attack rolls and strength, dexterity, and constitution saving throws for 1d4 turns after swapping bodies.</text>
    <text>At the end of a swapped creatures turn, it can choose to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a successful save. It its CR (or character level if it has no CR) is higher than the body of the creature it is, it has advantage on the save.</text>
    <text>If a creature dies while while it's soul is swapped, the souls return to their original bodies. If a soul was in a dying creature that returns to a living body, that creature takes 5d10 necrotic damage.</text>

    <text>On your turn, you can direct it to move (no action required) and it will continue to move as directed until you direct it to stop or reaches its destination. It can take no actions, but if it walks over a large or smaller creature, you can direct it to attempt to step on that creature, and that creature must succeed a Dexterity saving throw, or take 2d10 bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.</text>

    <text>At start of a creature's turn, if it is restrained by the spell, it takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage, and 2d10 necrotic damage. Each time a creature takes necrotic damage from this spell, the caster regains 1d4 hit points.</text>
    <text>A creature restrained by the tendrils can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself. A tendril can be destroyed, freeing a creature from its grasp. They have an AC of 10, 20 hit point, and are immune to all damage besides radiant and fire. Spells that deal radiant or fire damage to creatures in an area of effect also affect tendrils in that area.</text>

    <text>When you alter a roll, you can choose to cast aside subtlety and yank the thread of fate, and select any value of the d20 as the outcome of the result, but the backlash causes you to take a number d6 equal to the difference in the value selected from the value rolled in necrotic damage. The spell immediately ends after the result is changed in this more drastic way.</text>
