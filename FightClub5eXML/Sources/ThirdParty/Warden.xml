        <text>When you don light or medium armor, you can enhance it with mystical defenses, integrating it with manifestations of your primal bond (for example, an Elemental Soul may manifest icy plating to reinforce it). When you do so, you can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Dexterity modifier when calculating your AC with that armor.
        </text>
        <text>While you have your armor integrated with your primal power, when you take bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you can reduce the damage taken by 2. This value increases at 5th level (to 3), 9th level (to 4), and 13th level (to 5), and 17th level (to 6).

        <text>Additionally, at the end of your turn, you can choose to recklessly defend your allies within this area at the cost of your own safety, giving attacks against you advantage, and giving attacks against allies within the effect disadvantage if you are also in range of the attack being made (or have been at any point since the start of the attacker's turn).

    <text>A natural one handed melee weapon. Deals 1d6 slashing damage on hit, and has the Light, Reach, and Special Properties.</text>
    <text>Special: You can make a grapple check with this weapon targeting a creature you are currently grappling with it. On success, the creature is restrained while grappled.</text>
    <text>You can grapple creatures with this weapon with a reach equal to the weapon's reach. If a creature more than 5 feet away from you is grappled or restrained by you with this weapon their movement is not reduced to zero, but they can only move toward you. Once they are within 5 feet of you, their movement speed becomes zero.</text>
    <text>You can attempt to grapple creatures up to two sizes larger than you when initiating a grapple with this weapon, but creatures two sizes larger than you have their movement speed reduced by half, rather than reduced to zero. If they move out of range of your grapple, you can choose to release them or be pulled along with their movement.</text>

The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.</text>
    <text>The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.</text>

    <text>Targeting four unoccupied spaces that you can see within range, rooted carnivorous plants erupt from the ground, filling a 5-foot cube each. The ground within 5 feet of them becomes difficult terrain. When the plants appear, they each attack a creature of your choice within 5 feet of them. Each plant makes a melee spell attack, dealing 2d8 piercing damage on hit. Make a separate attack roll for each plant.</text>
    <text>If a creature ends their turn within 5 feet of one or more of the carnivorous plants, the plants automatically attack that creature unless you use your reaction to prevent them from doing so. The plants use your spell attack modifier, and deal 2d8 piercing damage on hit.</text>
    <text>The plants have AC 14 and 30 hit points, and have vulnerability to fire and slashing damage. Each plant regains all its hit points at the start of your turn if it has at least 1 hit point. A plant dies if it is reduced to zero hit points. When the spell ends, the plants wither and die leaving behind difficult terrain unless they were killed be fire damage.</text>
    <text>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can summon 1 additional carnivorous plant for each slot level above 4th.</text>
