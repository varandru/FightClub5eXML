        <text></text>
        <text>Spell Slots</text>
        <text>The Inventor table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Inventor spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of your Inventor spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>Spells Known of 1st level and higher</text>
        <text>You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the Inventor spell list. The Spells Known column of the Inventor table shows when you learn more Inventor spells of your choice</text>
        <text>Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
        <text>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Inventor spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Inventor spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>

        <text>In any case an existing upgrade is swapped out for a replacement upgrade (either by a subclass feature or on level up), the new upgrade is selected as if the Inventor is the level they were when they got that upgrade slot. For example, if you replace your Stormforged Weapon and reselect all of your upgrades as a 5th level Inventor, you could select one 3rd level upgrade and one 5th level upgrade, or two 3rd level upgrades, but you would not be able to select two 5th level upgrades.</text>

        <name>Potionsmith</name>
        <text>A potionsmith is an Inventor who has pursued the secrets of alchemy. While many a village has an apothecary grinding odd herbs and roots into potent (or not so potent) concoctions, the careful process of mixing and brewing is just one way to achieve results. Through the use of the intricate secrets of the craft and direct infusions using magical rituals, a potionsmith can come up with explosive results in the blink of an eye... sometimes literally.</text>
        <text>An potionsmith can be a scholar who has delved into the knowledge the world has to offer or an explorer that has unlocked the secrets of the wilderness. Their knowledge could come from being friends of the fey, or from unfettered access to the royal library. As such, potionsmith's can be good or evil, lawful or chaotic.</text>

        <text>When you choose this specialization at 1st level, you gain proficiency with Blowguns, Alchemist’s supplies and Herbalism kit.</text>
        <text>Your knowledge of alchemy gives you a natural affinity for brewing potions. Creating a potion through normal crafting takes you only half the time and cost it would normally take.</text>

        <name>Potionsmith: Alchemical Reagents Pouch</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you've acquired a pouch of useful basic reagents, much as a wizard might carry a component pouch. You've tucked away things that will come in handy, and can retrieve them as part of using an ability that might require them. As long as you have this pouch on, you use the potionsmith's features. This pouch is considered as alchemy supplies for the purposes of crafting.</text>
        <text>If you lose your reagent pouch, you can spend 50 gold pieces to reacquire the various stocks you need, or spend 1 full day gathering them from a natural environment without expense.</text>

        <text>Moreover, you know enough ways to do these that with just a few standard supplies, you can get these results out of a wide range of things you can gather in almost any locale and a pinch from your reagent pouch.</text>

        <text>At 3rd level, you have discovered the secrets to drastically bypass the alchemical brewing process, crafting potent magical effects through the direct infusion of the potion with your own magic. When you finish a short or long rest and have an empty vial on your person, you may choose one or more the following spells and use spell slots to cast them.</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>Spell   Infusion Spells</text>

        <text> 5th    cloudkill, skill empowerment</text>
<text></text>
        <text>When you cast spells in this way, the spell does not take effect immediately, but is infused into the potion.</text>
        <text>If the spell grants an effect or restores health, a creature can consume it or administrator it to another creature as an action.</text>
        <text>If a spell targets an area of effect, you can accurately throw a vial up to 30 feet, dealing no inherent damage, but breaking the vial in impact. The area of effect takes place when the vial is broken, with the effect centered on where the vial breaks. If the spell targets a creature, you can treat the vial as a ranged weapon you have proficiency with the Thrown (20/60) property. You replace the spell attack with making a weapon attack made with the vial</text>
        <text>If the spell has a persistent effect that requires concentration, it does not require concentration to maintain, but its duration is shortened to a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier</text>
        <text>A spell that does not require concentration lasts its normal duration. An infused potion loses its potency if it is not used by the end of your next long rest.</text>

  <text>As an action you can produce a reaction causing a searing flame. At a point within 20 feet, you can a toss quick combination of reagents that will cause searing fire to flare up in a 5 foot radius. Creatures in that area have to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, or take 1d8 fire damage.</text>
  <text>The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</text>
  <text>Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to prepare it as a ranged weapon you have proficiency in lasting until the end of your turn with the Thrown (20/60) and Finesse property that deals damage equal to failing the save against the effect (but does not add your Strength or Dexterity modifier).</text>

  <text>You can produce a reaction causing a caustic acid to form. As an action, you can throw this combination of ingredients at a point within 20 feet, causing acid to splatter within a 5 foot radius. Creatures in that area have to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, or take 2d4 acid damage. Damage from this acid deals double damage against structures and objects.</text>
  <text>The damage increases by 2d4 when you reach 5th level (4d4), 11th level (6d4), and 17th level (8d4).</text>

Cold or Fire effect a 10 foot cone. Lightning or Acid effect at 15 foot line. Creatures in that area have to make a Dexterity saving throw against your Spell Save DC, or take 1d8 damage of the elemental type chosen.</text>
  <text>The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</text>

Creatures within 10 feet of the target point must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, or take 1d10 thunder damage from the shockwave of the explosion.</text>
  <text>The damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).</text>
  <text>Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to prepare it as a ranged weapon you have proficiency in lasting until the end of your turn with the Thrown (20/60) and Finesse property that deals damage equal to failing the save against the effect (but does not add your Strength or Dexterity modifier).</text>

Creatures within 10 feet of the target point can choose to hold their breath and not inhale, but creatures that inhale the fumes gain 1d4 temporary hit points, deal 1d4 additional damage on their next melee weapon attack, and have advantage on their next Constitution saving throw. Any remaining benefits fade at the end of your next turn.</text>

  <name>INV:PSM00 Delivery Mechanism</name>
  <prerequisite></prerequisite>
  <text>You modify the stability of your reagents and develop a better delivery mechanism. You can target a point within 40 feet for your instant reactions (including ones gained from Upgrades, such as Explosive Reaction) that target a point. The additional precision allows you to better target the effects, allowing creatures of your choice within the target area to automatically pass a Dexterity saving throw against your effects.</text>
  <text>Additionally, when making attack rolls using Infused Potions or Instant Reactions, you can use your Intelligence in place of your Dexterity for the attack roll.</text>
</feat>
<feat>
  <name>INV:PSM00 Frostbloom Reaction</name>
  <prerequisite></prerequisite>
  <text>Instant Reaction (upgrade only)</text>
  <text></text>
  <text>You develop an endothermic reaction, a devastating localized cold snap that creates an instant bloom of ice. Targeting a point within 20 feet, as an action, you cause the area to erupt in frost.</text>
  <text>The area within 5 feet of the target point becomes difficult terrain until the end of your next turn, and any creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Spell Save DC, or be caught by the ice taking 1d6 cold damage; a creature entirely in the area of effect that fails also becomes restrained until the end of their next turn. They can use their action to make a Strength saving throw to break free of the ice early.</text>

    <text>You can set a magical trap by infusing explosive magic into an item. You can set this item to detonate when someone comes within 5 feet of it, or by a verbal command using your reaction (one or more mines can be detonated).</text>
    <text>When the magic trap detonates, each creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on the item must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature is in the area of effect of more than one fireburst mine during a turn, they take half damage from any subsequent effects of the mines.</text>
    <text>A magical mine must be set 5 feet or more from another mine, and cannot be moved once placed; any attempt to move it results in it detonating unless the Inventor that set it disarms it with an action.</text>

    <text>You touch a construct or inanimate object, causing it to regain 10d6 hit points. This causes any parts or material that has broken away from the construct or object to reattach, repairing it to the condition it was in before losing those hit points</text>
    <text>If the construct or object damaged state is the result of age, you can instead repair to the condition it was in 10d6 years ago, if it was previously in a better condition during that time (the condition can only improve or not change).</text>
    <text>At Higher Levels: The hit points restored increases by 2d6 (or the years restored) for each slot above 4th.</text>

    <text>You touch a weapon and imbue it with power. Until the spell ends, the weapon becomes indescribably sharp, ignoring resistance to slashing damage, and gains the Siege property, dealing double damage to inanimate objects such as structures. If a weapon has a modifier of less than +3 to attack and damage rolls, its modifier becomes +3 to attack and damage rolls for the duration of the spell.</text>
    <text>Additionally, if a critical strike of this weapon would leave a creature with less than 50 hitpoints, the target creature is decapitated, killing it.</text>

  <text>As an action you can produce a reaction causing a searing flame. At a point within 20 feet, you can a toss quick combination of reagents that will cause searing fire to flare up in a 5 foot radius. Creatures in that area have to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, or take 1d8 fire damage.</text>
  <text>The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</text>
  <text>Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to prepare it as a ranged weapon you have proficiency in lasting until the end of your turn with the Thrown (20/60) and Finesse property that deals damage equal to failing the save against the effect (but does not add your Strength or Dexterity modifier).</text>
