        <text>You cannot transfer any properties from a magical weapon besides a bonus to attack and damage rolls, and the original weapon is destroyed.</text>

        <text></text>
        <text>Spell Slots</text>
        <text>The Inventor table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Inventor spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of your Inventor spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>Spells Known of 1st level and higher</text>
        <text>You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the Inventor spell list. The Spells Known column of the Inventor table shows when you learn more Inventor spells of your choice</text>
        <text>Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</text>
        <text>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Inventor spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Inventor spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</text>

        <text>In any case an existing upgrade is swapped out for a replacement upgrade (either by a subclass feature or on level up), the new upgrade is selected as if the Inventor is the level they were when they got that upgrade slot. For example, if you replace your Stormforged Weapon and reselect all of your upgrades as a 5th level Inventor, you could select one 3rd level upgrade and one 5th level upgrade, or two 3rd level upgrades, but you would not be able to select two 5th level upgrades.</text>

        <name>Potionsmith</name>
        <text>A potionsmith is an Inventor who has pursued the secrets of alchemy. While many a village has an apothecary grinding odd herbs and roots into potent (or not so potent) concoctions, the careful process of mixing and brewing is just one way to achieve results. Through the use of the intricate secrets of the craft and direct infusions using magical rituals, a potionsmith can come up with explosive results in the blink of an eye... sometimes literally.</text>
        <text>An potionsmith can be a scholar who has delved into the knowledge the world has to offer or an explorer that has unlocked the secrets of the wilderness. Their knowledge could come from being friends of the fey, or from unfettered access to the royal library. As such, potionsmith's can be good or evil, lawful or chaotic.</text>

      <feature optional="YES">
        <name>Potionsmith: Potionsmith's Proficiency</name>
        <text>When you choose this specialization at 1st level, you gain proficiency with Blowguns, Alchemist’s supplies and Herbalism kit.</text>
        <text>Your knowledge of alchemy gives you a natural affinity for brewing potions. Creating a potion through normal crafting takes you only half the time and cost it would normally take.</text>

        <name>Potionsmith: Alchemical Reagents Pouch</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you've acquired a pouch of useful basic reagents, much as a wizard might carry a component pouch. You've tucked away things that will come in handy, and can retrieve them as part of using an ability that might require them. As long as you have this pouch on, you use the potionsmith's features. This pouch is considered as alchemy supplies for the purposes of crafting.</text>
        <text>If you lose your reagent pouch, you can spend 50 gold pieces to reacquire the various stocks you need, or spend 1 full day gathering them from a natural environment without expense.</text>

        <text>Moreover, you know enough ways to do these that with just a few standard supplies, you can get these results out of a wide range of things you can gather in almost any locale and a pinch from your reagent pouch.</text>

        <name>Potionsmith: Alchemical Infusions</name>
        <text>At 3rd level, you have discovered the secrets to drastically bypass the alchemical brewing process, crafting potent magical effects through the direct infusion of the potion with your own magic. When you finish a short or long rest and have an empty vial on your person, you may choose one or more the following spells and use spell slots to cast them.</text>
        <text></text>
        <text>Spell   Infusion Spells</text>
        <text> 1st    cure wounds, fog cloud, grease, heroism</text>

        <text> 4th    stoneskin, confusion</text>
        <text> 5th    cloudkill, skill empowerment</text>
        <text>When you cast spells in this way, the spell does not take effect immediately, but is infused into the potion.</text>
        <text>If the spell grants an effect or restores health, a creature can consume it or administrator it to another creature as an action.</text>
        <text>If a spell targets an area of effect, you can accurately throw a vial up to 30 feet, dealing no inherent damage, but breaking the vial in impact. The area of effect takes place when the vial is broken, with the effect centered on where the vial breaks. If the spell targets a creature, you can treat the vial as a ranged weapon you have proficiency with the Thrown (20/60) property. You replace the spell attack with making a weapon attack made with the vial</text>
        <text>If the spell has a persistent effect that requires concentration, it does not require concentration to maintain, but its duration is shortened to a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier</text>
        <text>A spell that does not require concentration lasts its normal duration. An infused potion loses its potency if it is not used by the end of your next long rest.</text>

    <text>Bind. The rope attempts to bind a creature of your choice within 20 feet of you. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained until it is freed. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the rope (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the rope.</text>
    <text>Fasten. The rope flies up 60 feet and ties one end to an object or surface that a rope could be tied to, before becoming inanimate again, hanging from the object</text>
    <text>Grab. The rope lashes out grabs one Small or smaller object that is not being worn by a creature within a range equal to the length of the rope and pulls that object back to your hand. If that object is being carried by a creature, it must make a Strength saving throw. On success, it retains the object, and on failure the object is pulled from the creature.</text>
    <text>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target a chain instead of a rope. It has the same available actions, but it has a DC 15, an AC of 15, and resistance to slashing damage when taking the Bind action. When cast with a spell slot of 3rd level or higher targeting a rope, that rope is magically imbued for 1 minute, gaining an DC of 15, an AC 20, and 20 hit points.</text>

    <text>You touch a piece of ammunition or weapon with the thrown property imbuing it with the property of seeking its target. When a ranged attack roll is made with that weapon that attack gains advantage and the attack roll can add your spell casting modifier to the value on the dice. If that makes the value on the die + your spell casting modifier results in a 20 or more, the attack is a critical hit as if a 20 was rolled. After making the attack roll, the spell ends.</text>
