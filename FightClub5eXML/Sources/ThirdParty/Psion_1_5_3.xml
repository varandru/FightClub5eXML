        <name>Psionic Archetype</name>
        <text>At 1st level, you pick the archetype of psion you embody, choosing from Awakened Mind, Unleashed Mind, Transcended Mind, Shaper’s Mind, Wandering Mind, or Consuming Mind, each of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level, and again at 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

      <feature>
        <name>Psionics</name>
        <text>Psionic Disciplines</text>
        <text>You are granted access to a psionic discipline (such as Telepathy or Telekinesis) by your chosen archetype. A psionic discipline comes with a passive feature that expands your character’s capabilities and an active psionic power that can be modified and empowered with psi points. Additionally you can use your discipline in more detailed applications to recreate the effect of certain spells, listed at the end of the discipline description. At 3rd level you can select a second discipline, and 18th level you can select a 3rd discipline.</text>
        <text>Psionic powers are suppressed by antimagic fields and can be dispelled with dispel magic, but are only affected by counterspell if recreating the effect of a spell. Any check required to dispel magic, counterspell or to identify a spell being cast with psionics is made with disadvantage unless the caster also has the Psionics feature. The detect magic spell will detect the usage of psionics, but not their nature: it will show up as a mysterious untyped power, even if being used to generate the effect of a spell.</text>
        <text>When recreating a spell through a psionic effect (using a psionic discipline to cast the spell) the spell has no material or verbal components, but using any psionic ability requires somatic components and causes the psion to vibrantly glow with the otherworldly psionic energies they are controlling.</text>
        <text>Psi Points</text>
        <text>Starting at 1st level, you gain access to psi points used to fuel psionic discipline powers and effects. You have a number of psi points equal to your psion level, and you regain all spent points when you finish a short or long rest. You can spend a number of psi points equal to half your Psion level (rounded up) at a time. For example, if you’re a 5th-level Psion, you can spend 3 psi points on a psionic power or cast a spell with a cost of 3 psi points.</text>
        <text>Psionic Ability</text>
        <text>Psionic powers, Psionic Talents, and spells gained through this class use your psionic ability.</text>
        <text>Psionic ability save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</text>

At higher levels, you gain more innate abilities of your choice that can be used in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Innate Psionics when you finish a long rest.</text>

    <autolevel level="1">
      <feature>
        <name>Psion Archetype: Awakened Mind</name>
        <text>An Awakened Mind is a psion who had their psionic power awakened within them by an encounter, event, or circumstance. Perhaps their powers were latent or perhaps their destiny had been that of a normal creature until powers were suddenly thrust on them. Perhaps they brushed the realms beyond in a vivid dream, perhaps they wandered the Feywild and came back warped, perhaps they merely glimpsed the eyes of a creature that did not belong walking down the street.</text>
        <text>An awakening is often somewhat traumatic. Psions are not well understood and the first power they manifest—telepathy — is one of the most feared and shunned abilities</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Awakened Mind: Opened Mind</name>
        <text>At 1st level when you select this archetype, your mind awakens the ability to directly connect to the minds of other creatures, granting the psionic discipline of Telepathy.</text>
      </feature>
      <feature>
        <name>Awakened Mind: Mental Awareness</name>
        <text>Additionally, starting at 1st level, you can use Intelligence instead of Wisdom when making an Insight check against a creature with an Intelligence ability score of 6 or higher.</text>
        <text>Further, if you have telepathically communicated with a willing creature, you know their general location (direction and rough estimate of distance) for the next hour as long as you are on the same plane as them</text>
      </feature>

    <autolevel level="3">
      <feature>
        <name>Awakened Mind: Mind Reader</name>
        <text>Starting at 3rd level, when you use Telepathic Intrusion, you can force the target to make an Intelligence saving throw instead of a Wisdom saving throw against the power (deciding when you use the ability).</text>
        <text>When a creature fails a saving throw against your Telepathic Intrusion, you gain a d4. Until the end of your next turn, if you make an attack roll against the creature or the creature makes a saving throw against one of your psionic powers other than Telepathic Intrusion, you can add or subtract the d4 from the roll (deciding to roll before you roll the attack or use the power).</text>

You gain a mindsight of 60 feet, allowing you to see creatures with an Intelligence of 6 or higher within range as if by blindsight.

    <autolevel level="1">
<feature optional="YES">
        <name>Psion Archetype: Unleashed Mind</name>
        <text>An Unleashed Mind’s power is most often an innate force they struggle to understand or control, a reflection of their state of mind and mood projected onto the world around them, often to devastating results. The life of an Unleashed Psion is frequently their journey to control their unruly powers... or one of embracing the destructive powers fully.</text>
        <text>What the wellspring of their innate power is varies: they could be a psionic race, born under the influence of distant twisted powers, warped by fey blood, or a herald of something more sinister brushing against the material world. Sometimes their power will show itself in simple applications, but most often their power becomes known and feared when their temper flares.</text>
        <text>Their alignment frequently depends on the approach to their powers they have taken. An Unleashed Psion who emphasizes control and restraint, keeping their emotions from running wild and their powers from running rampant will most often be lawful, following strict personal codes. On the other hand, an Unleashed Psion who lets their power run rampant will almost always be chaotic in nature, acting on impulse... with great emphasis.</text>
      </feature>
<feature optional="YES">
        <name>Unleashed Mind: Unshackled Power</name>
        <text>At 1st level when you select this archetype, you gain the ability to unleash your mind to physically interact with the world around you, granting you the psionic discipline of Telekinesis.</text>

        <name>Unleashed Mind: Overwhelming Power</name>
        <text>Additionally at 1st level, you gain the ability to cast thaumaturgy with your psionic powers. When you cast it in this way, you have an additional options:</text>
        <text>• You cause up to 10 pounds of loose objects within 10 feet of you to start floating for 1 minute.</text>
        <text>• You can force all targets within 5 feet to make a Strength saving throw, or be pushed 5 feet away from you.</text>

        <text>Starting at 3rd level, you gain a d4 rampage die. Once on each of your turns when making a damage roll, you can add this rampage die to the damage roll. If you dealt damage during your last turn, your rampage die becomes a d6, increasing with each subsequent turn you deal damage by one step, up to a d12; if you did not deal damage during your last turn or become incapacitated, it becomes a d4 once more.

    <autolevel level="1">
<feature optional="YES">
        <name>Psion Archetype: Transcended Mind</name>
        <text>A Transcended psion is most often one that has found their path to psionic powers through a mental epiphany, realizing the place of their mind within the multiverse and how it ties to everything else, seeing the keys and levers to the world laid out before them in their mind’s eye.</text>
        <text>Most often achieved either intentionally or accidentally through meditation and ritual, this can sometimes even be a passed on technique to reliably transcend the strictly material concerns, and explore the more cognitive realm and powers within.</text>
        <text>Transcended Psions tend to have the best grasp on their powers in control and principle, having come to understand the greater cosmos, but lack the reckless abandon some other Psions may have. Unfortunately less transcendent minds frequently cannot understand the greater truths they have learned and may view a Transcended Psion as a bit... peculiar.</text>

    <text>You can manifest your emotions into elemental powers that take physical shape. While you are in an elemental emotion, you can expend 2 psi points to manifest that emotion into the world as a bonus action; this takes the form of a mephit (ice mephit for cold, magma mephit for fire, and dust mephit for lightning).</text>
    <text>As your emotion, given form, it acts immediately after your initiative at your directive. If not destroyed, it lasts for up to 1 minute, after which it naturally fades away. You can’t manifest more than one emotion at a time, and if it is destroyed, you take 2d6 psychic damage from the backlash.</text>
    <text>This manifestation is not a sentient creature of its own, but simply a manifestation of your emotion.</text>

<!-- General Talents -->
<feat>
  <name>Talent: Astral Arms</name>
  <prerequisite></prerequisite>

When you see the creature’s aura in this way, you can determine if there are any spells or magical effects affecting the creature, and you learn their schools of magic, if any. You can also determine if the creature is under the influence of psionics. A shapeshifter or creature that is transformed or disguised by magical or nonmagical means must make a Charisma (Deception) check against your Psionics save DC.

</feat>
<feat>

  <prerequisite>9th-level Psion</prerequisite>
  <text>You learn the divide self spell, and can cast it by expending 5 psi points. When you gain access to the Innate Psionics feature, you may expend a use of Innate Psionics to cast divide self at the level of the use of Innate Psionics expended. For example, if you choose the teleport spell for your Innate Psionics feature at 13th level, you could expend a casting of teleport to instead cast divide self as a 7th-level spell, and can’t cast teleport or divide self as a 7th-level spell in this way until you finish a long rest.</text>
  <text>You do not require the material components of the spell when you cast it by expending psi points or a use of Innate Psionics.</text>

</feat>
<feat>
  <name>Talent: Elemental Penetration</name>
  <prerequisite>Elemental Mind subclass</prerequisite>
  <text>When you use a psionic power or spell that deals cold, fire, or lightning damage, you can expend 1 psi point to make the power ignore resistance to that elemental damage damage type.</text>
  <text>If you have a specialization of Psychokinesis, if the target has immunity to the damage type chosen, this instead turns immunity into resistance for that power.</text>
  <text>You can spend psi points granted by Psionic Mastery on this ability.</text>
</feat>
<feat>
  <name>Talent: Empowered Strike</name>
  <prerequisite>Psychokinesis or Telekinetics Discipline</prerequisite>
  <text>Once per turn, as part of making a weapon attack as part of the Attack action, you can empower a melee weapon you are holding with psionic power. When you hit a creature with a weapon, you can apply Elemental Blast or Telekinetic Force modifiers (you can only select a power you know) to the attack (you can use Psionic Mastery on this). This doesn’t deal the base damage of the power, but any added damage causes the additional effects of the power to occur.</text>
  <text>When applying a modifier that would make it target an area of effect, only the target takes the weapon damage, but other creatures in the radius become a target of the attack as if using the power normally.</text>
</feat>

  <text>During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. You can end this effect at any time. While this is active, the creature has advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.</text>
</feat>
<feat>
  <name>Talent: Perfect Focus</name>
  <prerequisite>10th-level Psion</prerequisite>
  <text>You can enter a state of extreme focus. Your concentration is no longer interrupted by using a second ability that requires concentration, but your speed is reduced to 0 while concentrating on more than one effect; you have a −5 penalty to any Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration. If you move or fail a save to maintain concentration, one of the spells you are concentrating on ends. If you fail the saving throw to maintain concentration by 5 or more, you lose concentration on both spells.</text>
</feat>
<feat>
  <name>Talent: Personal Truth</name>
  <prerequisite></prerequisite>
  <text>Your power of conviction allows you to believe what you choose to. If you spend at least one minute convincing yourself of something—no matter how absurd—spells and effects to determine if you are telling the truth will register that you believe what you have convinced yourself of.</text>
  <text>Additionally, your psionic powers allow you to impose your will upon reality to a certain extent. When you expend 1 psi point, you can perform a minor alteration to reality:</text>
  <text>• You can conjure any Tiny object you can imagine that is worth 1 sp or less. This creates an object as you envision it, but doesn’t grant you knowledge you do not otherwise have (for example, you would be unable to conjure a key to a lock unless you had a perfect mental image of the correct key).</text>
  <text>• As an action, you can change the color or taste of a Small or smaller object with 10 feet. This change lasts for 1 minute.</text>
  <text>• As a reaction to a creature within 30 feet taking damage (including yourself), you can change the damage type they take.</text>

</feat>
<feat>
  <name>Talent: Psi Crystal</name>
  <prerequisite></prerequisite>
  <text>You gain the ability to impart part of your mind into crystal. You can expend 2 psi points to cast the find familiar spell, but your familiar takes on the statics of a psi crystal (below) and the material component required is a crystal worth 10 gp instead of the normal material components. The Psi Crystal gains your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can use Psionic Disciplines with a range greater than self through your Psi Crystal as if you were standing in its location. If the psi crystal is destroyed, you gain its memories as your own. While you have a Psi Crystal active, as a bonus action, you can deactivate it to regain 2 expended psi points.</text>
  <text>When you summon a Psi Crystal, you can store a fragment of your personality in it that you can then release by shattering the crystal. Select one of the following when summoning a psi crystal.</text>
  <text>Courage. When you make a saving throw against the frightened condition, you can use your reaction to shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion to gain advantage on the save.</text>
  <text>Cowardice. When your Psi Crystal is within 30 of you and a creature comes within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion and immediately moving up to your speed away from the creature without taking any opportunity attacks.</text>
  <text>Cruelty. When your Psi Crystal is within 30 feet of a creature that takes damage, you can use your reaction to shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion and causing the creature to take additional damage equal to your psion level.</text>
  <text>Sympathy. When your Psi Crystal is within 30 feet of you and another creature, if that creature takes damage, you can use your reaction to shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion and granting the creature resistance to that damage. You take an equal amount of damage to the damage they take.</text>

  <name>Talent: Schism</name>
  <prerequisite>5th-level Psion</prerequisite>
  <text>You can spend 1 psi point to temporarily divide your mind to do two things at once until the end of your turn. While dividing your mind, if you use your action on a psionic power or spell granted by a Psionic Discipline, you can use your bonus action to use a psionic power that would normally take an action. The two powers share your per use psi point limit between them.</text>

  <duration>Concentration, up to 1 minute</duration>
  <text>You project an ethereal creation from your mind at a space you can see within range, taking the shape of a Medium or smaller creature, weapon, or other object. This creation is clearly ethereal in nature. When you create it, and on subsequent turns using your action to mentally control it, you can move it up to 30 feet in any direction and attack, so long as it doesn’t move beyond the range of the power. To attack with it, make a melee spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage. If the Astral Construct moves out of range of the spell, it fades away into nothing, ending the spell.</text>
  <text>While the Astral Construct is active, you can spend psi points up to your per use limit to issue commands that affect and empower your construct. Commands require no action, but you can’t exceed your psi point limit in total commands issued, and each command can only be issued once per turn.</text>
  <text>Grab (1 psi point): Can only be used while your construct is Solidified. A target creature within 5 feet of your construct that is no more than one size larger than the construct must make a Strength saving throw or become restrained by the construct. At the end of each of the restrained creature’s turns it can repeat the saving throw. The condition ends if the construct becomes ethereal again, or becomes more than one size smaller than the target.</text>
  <text>Grow (1 psi point): Your construct increases by one size, and its number of damage dice increases by one. It returns to its normal size at the start of your next turn. It can only gain one additional die (for example, up to 2d8)</text>
  <text>Relocate (1 psi point): The construct disappears and reappears anywhere within 60 feet of you.</text>
  <text>Replicate (3 psi points): You use Relocate, but the original doesn’t disappear. Until the end of your turn, you have another construct and control both with the same action (commands only affect one of your choice). Pick one construct to fade at the start of your next turn or use Sustain.</text>
  <text>Solidify (1 psi point): Your construct becomes solid, blocking its space until the start of your next turn. You can only use this command if it is in an unoccupied space. It has an armor class of 16 and hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier + your psion level. The construct becomes ethereal again if it drops to zero hit points.</text>
  <text>Strike (2 psi points): The construct makes an attack (even if it has already attacked).</text>
  <text>Sustain (1+ psi points): At the start of your turn, you can sustain the effect of a Solidify, Grow or Replicate command for an additional round. An effect that has been replicated can be sustained across all replicated constructs with a single use, but each effect can only be sustained once per turn (for example, you can never sustain more than one replicated construct). This costs 1 psi point for each effect sustained. Sustaining Solidify refreshes the construct’s hit points to its maximum.</text>

If their movement would be stopped early by a creature or object, both the target and creature or object takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.</text>

  <text>You assault the mind of a target you can see within range, rending and devouring its psionic energy. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or take 1d6 psychic damage. If the target is frightened, charmed, stunned, restrained, grappled, or paralyzed, the psychic damage becomes 1d12 instead. On a failed save, you gain a psionic charge of consumed power until the end of your next turn. You can expend this charge when you deal damage to deal additional damage equal to your Intelligence modifier, or consume this charge at the end of your turn to gain temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier. You can spend only one charge at a time.</text>
  <text>You can target the corpse of a recently perished creature with this power, as long as the target has died within the last minute and not been previously leeched by this power.</text>
  <text>Devouring (2 psi points): The range of Mind Leech becomes a radius of 5 feet, centered on you.</text>
  <text>Nourishing (1 psi point): On a failed saving throw, you gain an additional psionic charge.</text>
  <text>Rending (1+ psi points): The target takes an additional die of damage (1d6 or 1d12 as applicable if they are under the effect of a listed condition) per psi point spent on a failed save.</text>
  <text>Shredding (1 psi point): You leave the target’s mind and soul shredded, reducing their next saving throw before the end of your next turn by 1d4.</text>
  <text>Stunning (3 psi points): On a failed saving throw, the target becomes stunned until the start of your next turn. If the power affects multiple targets, select one target for this effect.</text>
  <text>Thieving (1 psi point): On a failed saving throw, you can draw a 5th level or lower spell the target can cast from its mind (from a Spellcasting or Psionics feature). You must be aware that it can cast that spell; the target retains the ability to cast the spell, but you gain the ability to cast the spell using your Psionics feature by spending psi points equal to the level of the spell (restricted by your psi point limit; you can’t use Psionic Mastery to cast this spell).</text>
  <text>You can know one spell in this manner at a time, and retain the ability to cast the spell for 1 minute or until cast. If the spell is one that restores hit points, you reduce your own hit points by the amount healed by the spell.</text>
